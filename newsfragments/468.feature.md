The analyzer now uses a query-based system, which fixes some shortcomings of the previous implementation.

- Types can now refer to other types defined later in the file.
Example:
```
type Posts = Map<PostId, PostBody>
type PostId = u256
type PostBody = String<140>
```

- Duplicate definition errors now show the location of the original definition.
- The analysis of each function, type definition, etc happens independently, so an error in one
doesn't stop the analysis pass. This means fe can report more user errors in a single run of the compiler.
