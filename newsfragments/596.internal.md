The fe analyzer now builds a dependency graph of source code "items" (functions, contracts, structs, etc).
This is used in the yulgen phase to determine which items are needed in the yul (intermediate representation)
output. Note that the yul output is still cluttered with utility functions that may or may not be needed by
a given contract. These utility functions are defined in the yulgen phase and aren't tracked in the dependency
graph, so it's not yet possible to filter out the unused functions. We plan to move the definition of many
of these utility functions into fe; when this happens they'll become part of the dependency graph and will only
be included in the yul output when needed.

The dependency graph will also enable future analyzer warnings about unused code.
