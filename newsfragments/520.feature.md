The `self` variable is no longer implicitly defined in code blocks. It must now be declared
as the first parameter in a function signature.

Example:

```
contract Foo:
    my_stored_num: u256

    pub fn bar(self, my_num: u256):
        self.my_stored_num = my_num
        
    pub fn baz(self):
        self.bar(my_pure_func())
        
    pub fn my_pure_func() -> u256:
        return 42 + 26
```
