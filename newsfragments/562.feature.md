Added support for multi-file inputs.

**Implementation details:**

Mostly copied Rust's crate system, but use the the term *ingot* instead of crate.

Below is an example of an ingot's file tree, as supported by the current implementation.

```
`-- basic_ingot
    `-- src
        |-- bar
        |   `-- baz.fe
        |-- bing.fe
        |-- ding
        |   |-- dang.fe
        |   `-- dong.fe
        `-- main.fe
```

There are still a few features that will be worked on over the coming months:

- source files accompanying each directory module (e.g. `my_mod.fe`)
- configuration files and the ability to create library ingots
- test directories
- module-level `pub` modifier (all items in a module are public)
- `mod` statements (all fe files in the input tree are public modules)

These things will be implemented in order of importance over the next few months.
