Added support for explicit casting between numeric types.

Example:

```
let a: i8 = i8(-1)
let a1: i16 = i16(a)
let a2: u16 = u16(a1)

assert a2 == u16(65535)

let b: i8 = i8(-1)
let b1: u8 = u8(b)
let b2: u16 = u16(b1)

assert b2 == u16(255)
```

Notice that Fe allows casting between any two numeric types but does not allow
to change both the sign and the size of the type in one step as that would leave
room for ambiguity as the example above demonstrates.
