Encode certain reverts as panics.

With this change, the following reverts are encoded as `Panic(uint256)` with
the following panic codes:

`0x01`: An assertion that failed and did not specify an error message
`0x11`: An arithmetic expression resulted in an over- or underflow
`0x12`: An arithmetic expression divided or modulo by zero

The panic codes are aligned with [the panic codes that Solidity uses](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.4/control-structures.html?highlight=Panic#panic-via-assert-and-error-via-require).
