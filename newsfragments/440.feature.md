The following checks are now performed while decoding data:

- The size of the encoded data fits within the size range known at compile-time.
- Values are correctly padded.
  - unsigned integers, addresses, and bools are checked to have correct left zero padding
  - the size of signed integers are checked
  - bytes and strings are checked to have correct right padding
- Data section offsets are consistent with the size of preceding values in the data section.
- The dynamic size of strings does not exceed their maximum size.
- The dynamic size of byte arrays (`u8[n]`) is equal to the size of the array.
