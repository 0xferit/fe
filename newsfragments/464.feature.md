Revert with custom errors

Example:

```
struct PlatformError:
  code: u256

pub def do_something():
  revert PlatformError(code=4711)
```

Error encoding [follows Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.4/abi-spec.html#errors) which is based on [EIP-838](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/838). This means that custom errors returned from Fe are fully compatible with Solidity.
