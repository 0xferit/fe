Added support for `unsafe` functions and `unsafe` blocks within functions.
Note that there's currently no functionality within Fe that requires the use
of `unsafe`, but we plan to add built-in `unsafe` functions that perform raw
evm operations which will only callable within an `unsafe` block or function.
