The Fe standard library now includes a `std::evm` module, which provides functions that perform low-level evm operations.
Many of these are marked `unsafe`, and thus can only be used inside of an `unsafe` function or an `unsafe` block.

Example:
```
use std::evm::{mstore, mload}

fn memory_shenanigans():
  unsafe:
    mstore(0x20, 42)
    let x: u256 = mload(0x20)
    assert x == 42
```

The global functions `balance` and `balance_of` have been removed; these can now be called as `std::evm::balance()`, etc.
The global function `send_value` has been ported to Fe, and is now available as `std::send_value`.
