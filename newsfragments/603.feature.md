Added unsafe low-level "intrinsic" functions, that perform raw evm operations.
For example:

```
fn foo():
  unsafe:
    __mtore(0, 5000)
    assert __mload(0) == 5000
```

The functions available are exactly those defined in yul's "evm dialect":
https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.11/yul.html#evm-dialect
but with a double-underscore prefix. Eg `selfdestruct` -> `__selfdestruct`.

These are intended to be used for implementing basic standard library functionality,
and shouldn't typically be needed in normal contract code.

Note: some intrinsic functions don't return a value (eg `__log0`); using these
functions in a context that assumes a return value of unit type (eg `let x: () = __log0(a, b)`)
will currently result in a compiler panic in the yul compilation phase.
