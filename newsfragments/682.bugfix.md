reject infinite size struct definitions.

Fe `structs` having infinite size due to recursive definitions were not rejected earlier and would cause ICE in the analyzer since they were not properly handled. Now `structs` having infinite size are properly identified by detecting cycles in the dependency graph of the struct field definitions and an error is thrown by the analyzer.
