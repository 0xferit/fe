Temporary default stateMutability to payable in ABI

The ABI metadata that the compiler currently generates does not include the `stateMutability` field. This piece of information is important for tooling such as hardhat because it determines whether a function needs to be called with or without sending a transaction.

As soon as we have support for `mut self` and `mut ctx` we will be able to derive that information from the function signature. In the meantime we now default to `payable`.
