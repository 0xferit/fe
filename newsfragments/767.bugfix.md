Fix issue where calls to assiciated functions did not enforce visibility rules.

E.g the following code should be rejected but previously wasn't:

```
struct Foo {
    fn do_private_things() {
    }
}

contract Bar {
    fn test() {
        Foo::do_private_things()
    }
}
```

With this change, the above code is now rejected because `do_private_things` is not `pub`.
